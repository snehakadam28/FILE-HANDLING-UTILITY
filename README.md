# Description of the Code:

The provided Java program, FileHandlingUtility, demonstrates fundamental file handling operations in Java using the FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader classes. The program performs the following tasks:

1. Create and Write to a File (createAndWriteFile method)

Creates a file named sample.txt.

Writes some sample text to the file.

Uses BufferedWriter for efficient writing.

2. Read the File (readFile method)

Reads the contents of sample.txt.

Uses BufferedReader to read the file line by line.

Displays the content on the console.

3. Modify the File (modifyFile method)

Appends a new line to the existing file without overwriting the original content.

Uses BufferedWriter in append mode (true flag in FileWriter).

4. Main Method Execution Flow

Calls createAndWriteFile() to create and write data.

Calls readFile() to display initial content.

Calls modifyFile() to append data to the file.

Calls readFile() again to verify the modification.
